Your repository must remain private at all times, leaving the content of the repository accessible to anyone other than the instructor, TA, and yourself will be considered as a violation of the rules of conduct and will have serious disciplinary consequences. If you are not sure whether you set up the access rights correctly, ask the instructor or the TA. If you discover that you can see the content of someone else's repository, inform the instructor or the TA. If this is a result of an honest mistake and it is promptly corrected, no disciplinary action will be taken.
